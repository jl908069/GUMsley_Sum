<h1>Wikinews interviews meteorological experts on Cyclone Phalin </h1><br></br><em><strong>File photo of interviewee David Titley . </h1>Image : David Titley . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>Wikinews:</b></br> <p>Cyclone Phailin has winds that have been measured at 200 km / h , as it surges over land will it begin to lose strength ? </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>Richman:</b></br> <p>Yes , all tropical cyclones are driven by high heat content waters . </h1>Once a storm moves over any appreciably sized piece of land , the moisture source is removed and the storm begins to dissipate . </h1>As of the last advisory , T C Phailin has winds of 190 kilometers per hour and has moved inland , headed on a northwest track . </h1>That is a Category 3 storm . </h1>The forecast is for a continued decline in strength to a tropical storm within 24 hours and a decline to a tropical depression within 36 hours . </h1>However , there will be very heavy rains and flooding along its path . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>Snow:</b></br> <p>Yes , it will loose strength steadily as more and more of this swirling system moves from being over ocean to being over land . </h1>This occurs for two reasons : </h1><br></br> As it moves over land , it is cut off from the source of energy driving the storm [ which is ] the evaporation of water from the warm sea surface ; </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Increased friction - the ocean surface is much , much smoother than the land surface . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>Saravanan:</b></br> <p>Tropical cyclones are sustained by a form of energy called latent heat , which is released by moisture evaporated from the ocean that condenses to form rain . </h1>As tropical cyclones make landfall , this energy source is cut - off and they rapidly lose strength as they move over land . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>Zhang:</b></br> <p>Yes , the Cyclone is almost certain to lose strength as it surges over land . </h1>Cyclones gather their strength through scraping moisture and heat from warm ocean water that it is not the case over land . </h1>In the mean time , much stronger friction over land quickly reduces their strength . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>Titley:</b></br> <p>Yes . </h1>All tropical cyclones lose strength once they make landfall . </h1>However , they can remain dangerous storms due to very heavy rains and subsequent landslides , and river flooding . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>Knight:</b></br> <p>Phailin's  winds will rapidly weaken as it pushes inland . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>Morrissey:</b></br> <p>Once Cyclone Phailin comes on shore it will immediately begin to lose strength . </h1>However , and this is important , it still will contain lots of rainfall making flooding an almost certainty . </h1><br></br><em><strong>File photo of interviewee R Saravanan . </h1>Image : R Saravanan . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>Wikinews:</b></br> <p>A previous cyclone in 1999 in the Bay of Bengal area of India left 10,000 people dead . </h1>Is the Indian government well prepared to deal with this cyclone ? </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>Richman:</b></br> <p>I have not followed that aspect of the societal response for the present storm . </h1>However , historically , there have been several events that should cause a societal response . </h1>Hopefully , we all learn from past mistakes . </h1>The history of strong cyclones and death in the region is notable , with at least 5 large cyclone events in the past 35 years with 10,000 and as many as 300,000 people killed , millions left homeless and estimated damages as high as US $ 10 billion . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>Snow:</b></br> <p>I don't  have enough information to answer this question , one way or the other . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>Saravanan:</b></br> <p>From all the press reports that I have read , the Indian government appears to have taken the threat of Cyclone Phailin very seriously indeed . </h1>The government has been much more pro-active in preparing for this cyclone than in the past . </h1>The forecasts of cyclone track and intensity have been fairly accurate . </h1>Mandatory mass evacuations have been carried out , which is essential to minimize loss of life in these situations . </h1>Unfortunately , extensive property damage is bound to occur even with the best preparation . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>Zhang:</b></br> <p>My knowledge of the responsiveness of the Indian government to this storm is purely from the cyber space . </h1>I heard that they orchestrated the largest people evacuation to a natural disaster in Indian history . </h1>This shall be applauded given the size and strength of Phailin . </h1>I visited the damaged area of the 1999 storm near Bhubaneshwar in the summer of 2012 for an invited symposium and summer school on tropical cyclones [ ... ] sponsored by the Indian government . </h1>Given the living standard and residence of people living near the coastal areas in this region , the evacuation is certainly necessary and essential to save lives . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>Titley:</b></br> <p>I cannot can not comment directly on how the Indian government was prepared for this cyclone . </h1>However , the news reports ( BBC etc. ) were very encouraging in that the authorities were reportedly making strenuous efforts to evacuate the population from near the coast and areas that are prone to flooding . </h1>Water is the main killer in these storms . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>Knight:</b></br> <p>From all reports that I have seen , the government was well prepared for this cyclone . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>Morrissey:</b></br> <p>For this question I don't  know the ' preparedness ' of the Indian gov't to deal with this .
