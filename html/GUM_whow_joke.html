<h1>How to Tell a Joke </h1><h1>Two Parts : </h1>Getting the Material Right </h1>Getting the Delivery Right </h1></strong></em></br> <p>From one - liners to classic three - liners to the one - minute gag you tell your friends , a good joke pleases everyone . </h1>Joke - telling is one of the best ways to ease tension , make a new friend , or light up a room . </h1>That is , of course , if you can get a laugh . </h1>Telling good jokes is an art that comes naturally to some people , but for others it takes practice and hard work . </h1><h1>Part 1 of 2 : </h1>Getting the Material Right </h1><br></br> Know your audience . </h1>All aspects of the joke you tell , from the content to the length , need to be suited to your audience . </h1>What’s What ’s funny to a group of 20 - year old college students may be very different from what makes your 70 - year old - uncle laugh ( then again , maybe not ) . </h1><br></br> Everyone’s Everyone ’s an individual , so there are no hard and fast rules . </h1>But , unless you personally know the members of your audience , here are some good rules of thumb to follow : </h1>elderly people won’t wo n’t like crude jokes ; </h1>stay away from misogynist jokes if you’ve you ’ve got an audience full of women ; </h1>people of a specific ethnic or racial group won’t wo n’t enjoy jokes making fun of their group ; </h1>and jokes requiring specialized knowledge ( of , for example , science or old movies ) will only be appreciated by people who possess that knowledge . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>The more you know about your audience the better you’ll you ’ll be able to tailor your jokes to them . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Choose great material . </h1>You can find fodder lots of places — from your life , joke files online , by repurposing jokes you’ve you ’ve heard in the past , and so on . </h1><br></br> You may want to start your own joke file . </h1>You can write your jokes down on index cards to keep them handy or use a document file on your computer . [ 1 ] </h1>The latter option may allow for easier revision . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Decide on a target . </h1>Every joke has a “ target , ” which is what the joke is about . </h1>It’s It ’s important that the joke’s joke ’s target ( the most basic element of your material ) be suited to your audience . </h1>Make sure it’s it ’s a target your audience will be interested in and something they’re they ’re likely willing to laugh at . [ 2 ] </h1><br></br> For example , husbands are likely to laugh at jokes about wives and vice versa ; </h1>students will typically find jokes about school and teachers humorous . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Have a realistic but exaggerated setup . </h1>The opening of the joke — or setup — should have a basis in the real world so your audience can relate to it , but it should also include exaggeration because this is what gives a joke its humorous edge . [ 3 ] </h1><br></br> Think of the setup as the foundation of a story . </h1>It’s It ’s a fundamental part of the joke ; </h1>if you don’t do n’t lay a good foundation here , then the punchline won’t wo n’t make sense to the audience or they won’t wo n’t find it humorous . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Your setup needs to be both realistic and exaggerated in order to be funny — </h1>it’s it ’s placing these two incongruous elements side by side that makes the joke funny . [ 4 ] </h1></strong></em></br> <p>The exaggeration can be slight or considerable — </h1>it just depends on the individual joke . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Surprise with the punchline . </h1>The ending of the joke is obviously crucial . </h1>This is where the payoff comes in , what makes the joke succeed or fail . </h1>If you want to make the audience laugh , your punchline needs to be surprising . </h1><br></br> Some jokes also have what is called a tag or topper , which is an additional punchline . </h1>The tag builds on the original punchline or twists back on it in a surprising way . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Make the joke your own . </h1>Lots of jokes rehash the same ground and sometimes they retell a story countless other jokes have told . </h1>For your joke to be funny , it has to surprise the audience in some way , which means it has to seem original or new . </h1><br></br> One way to personalize a joke is to change the ending . [ 5 ] </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Another option is to dress the joke up as a story about your own life . </h1>This will make a familiar joke unrecognizable . </h1>It may also make it particularly interesting if your audience is your friend(s) . [ 6 ] </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Know your material . </h1>Practicing your joke is crucial . </h1>You don’t do n’t need to have it completely memorized — in fact , you " shouldn’t should n’t " memorize it — but you need to be really comfortable with it , so comfortable that you can continue on with telling it even if you get nervous or sidetracked , which is very possible once you’re you ’re in front of an audience . </h1><br></br> Memorized jokes sound wooden , like they are being read off a script instead of relayed by a friend or entertainer . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Good jokes have a lot of details and personality , so don’t do n’t be afraid to embellish . [ 7 ] </h1>Try different things out and see what feels right , what sounds best . </h1>Don’t Do n’t use a joke until you’re you ’re completely comfortable with it . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Try recording your joke on a tape player and playing it back to yourself . </h1>If you hear a lot of awkward pauses or “ah”s or “um”s , your joke isn’t is n’t ready and you need to practice more . [ 8 ] </h1>You can also try practicing in front of a sympathetic friend or family member once you’re you ’re ready for a “ real ” audience .
