</strong></em></br> <br><b>DrCellini:</b></br> <p>What's What 's up YouTube ? </h1>So we are going to do a week of me vlogging . </h1>It's It 's kind of an interesting week . </h1>I bounced around here and there , so I have to kind of show you guys around and show you what it's it 's all about , and today I'm I 'm on general nuclear medicine , so let's let 's start the day . </h1>So like I said , I'm I 'm on my general nuclear medicine rotation this week . </h1>I get switched around -- moved around a few times to cover some residents who are on vacation , so I'll I 'll be at other spots later this week . </h1>So so far this morning I've I 've just read a few studies ( it's it 's a little slow in the morning ) of general nuclear medicine because a lot of stuff takes time for the radio tracers to go into the body or the specific organ we are targeting , so we have to wait a little bit in the morning . </h1>So I've I 've done three lymphoscintigraphies . </h1>For lymphoscintigraphies we basically inject technetium in skin surrounding a melanoma and after we inject we wait about 15 - 20 minutes , maybe up to an hour , and wait for that radio tracer to travel to the closest lymph node which we would call the sentinel lymph node . </h1>What we do is we mark it under our cameras and then the patient will go up to the OR , have the melanoma , a wide excision of the melanoma , and then they will try to find the lymph node that we marked and take that one out as well to make sure there's there 's no metastasis . </h1>So I've I 've done three of those this morning . </h1>I will read a few more scans coming up here shortly and just trying to tie up some loose ends before I go to conference . </h1>I'll I 'll check back in afterwards . </h1>Ah , the sun feels so good on the face . </h1>I'm I 'm officially done . </h1>It is about 4:00 p.m. </h1>We get to head home early today because we finished off the scans , and I'm I 'm gonna gon na go home and work out because I was too lazy to do it this morning because for some reason I was tired from having a weekend off , which makes no sense . </h1>But I'm I 'm gonna gon na go work out , cook something for dinner and do this all over again tomorrow . </h1>We're We 're on a different rotation tomorrow so stay tuned to find out which one . </h1>Alright it is day two . </h1>It is Tuesday and today I got pulled to ultrasound . </h1>Yes , I don't do n't know why I got pulled on today , but I did , so probably just sit in there , read some ultrasounds and get out early . </h1>I need to film another YouTube video . </h1>Alright so I've I 've been here just crushing ultrasounds , and today I've I 've been feeling a little under the weather so I've I 've been , like , yeah , I've I 've been like crushing these all day today and then I'll I 'll show you what else I've I 've been . </h1>I picked these up when I was in Amsterdam for ... </h1>I got sick when I was on Croatia for vacation . </h1>I have no idea what it says , but I think they're they 're cough drops , so if anybody knows what this says let me know . </h1>But I'm I 'm pretty sure it's it 's just cough drops with some vitamin C in it . </h1>So this is what I have been doing all day is crushing ultrasounds and having Dutch cough drops . </h1>So if anybody speaks Dutch tell me what that means . </h1>Oh and PS , I usually try to avoid taking medicines that I can't ca n't read the name of but I had someone help me at the pharmacy in the airport . </h1>She spoke a little bit of English and I think those are actually cough drops , so , that's that 's the only reason I'm I 'm still eating them today . </h1>You can tell by my voice it's it 's a little on the sore side today so hopefully I get better because , I haven't have n't told you guys yet , but I'm I 'm going somewhere this weekend and it's it 's gonna gon na be fun . </h1>Now it's it 's time to get back to work . </h1>So I'm I 'm officially going home right now . </h1>Yeah , normally I would go home and work out , especially since it's it 's , like , a beautiful day I would probably go running . </h1>But since I feel kind of crappy today I'm I 'm just going to go home , hang out , rest ( ambulance was a little loud sorry ) . </h1>So I'm I 'm probably just gonna gon na go home and rest and I have to get my hair cut today for my big trip coming up . </h1>But you still don't do n't know where I'm I 'm going . </h1>But yeah that's that 's pretty much it , hope you guys don't do n't mind this kind of like random vlog that I'm I 'm doing , but I just wanted to show you guys kind of loosely like how a week is and the life of a radiology resident . </h1>So hopefully you guys find it somewhat interesting , and if you do I'll I 'll keep doing it . </h1>So heading home now .
