</strong></em></br> <br><b>MelissaLucy:</b></br> <p>Hey what's  up guys ? </h1>Welcome back to my channel or welcome if you're  new . </h1>Today I'm  doing another college day in my life . </h1>And I just left Starbucks , don't  mind what I look like . </h1>I literally just pretty much woke up and left this morning . </h1>I'm  starting the review for all the chapters for my final exam , and it is a lot of information so I already planned on getting up early today and going . </h1>And then I'm  gonna gon na do the same thing tomorrow . </h1>I basically like created a digital calendar where I'm  gonna gon na go over each of the chapters , just because I only have one week left to study . </h1>I'm  back home now , and I basically just typed up a little calendar laying out the chapters that I have left to review before Tuesday . </h1>That's  my final list and I hate that , like , this week is our Thanksgiving break and then we literally come back Tuesday and take our final . </h1>So I'm  gonna gon na be studying on Thanksgiving Day , Black Friday , and the whole weekend even though we're  going getting our Christmas tree I think on Saturday , and I I'm  not decorating I'm  not doing anything fun , like I have to study . </h1>I thought I would show you guys kind of how I'm  mapping this out , because it's  a really good tip if you have like a lot to do . </h1>So today I'm  doing female reproductive system , doing male reproductive system tomorrow . </h1>I work on Wednesday , I'm  going to go over chapter 29 fluid balance , chapter 28 so urinary system on the 29th . </h1>The 30th , Chapters 17 through 22 - yes that's  like six chapters or something . </h1>And then on Sunday , I'll  be doing chapters 23 through 27 and I just made this on my iPad and then printed it . </h1>I did not include my schedule for college algebra because I have a final on Thursday of next week for that . </h1>So I'm  going to go in with like a different color and add in the chapters I'm  gonna gon na be studying for that , but I'm  super stressed . </h1>I bought these Vans from DSW . </h1>They are really cute . </h1>You guys know I have the white ones and I wear them all the time and these ones are just like black perforated Vans . </h1>I love them and they are definitely the right size because I have two other pairs of Vans that are this size , but one of these ones is like messed up or something . </h1>I think it's  like this part on the left foot because my foot feels super tight in only the left side , so something's  up because they're  both the right size but I don't  know . </h1>So I'm  gonna gon na exchange them for another pair because something's  not right about that . </h1>Hey guys . </h1>So I just got finished at the library . </h1>I just sat in there for like an hour and a half straight and studied . </h1>I'm  really proud of myself and now I'm  about to go get some lunch , and go to DSW and see if I can exchange those Vans . </h1>So while I was in the library one of you guys came up to me , and said hi . </h1>I feel so bad because I was so in the zone that I didn't  even get her name . </h1>But if you're  watching this , hi thank you so much for coming and saying hi to me you actually made my whole day . </h1>She said she watches my videos and loves them . </h1>And you guys are so sweet , I love making videos and it's  so nice to have that support . </h1>So if you do go to FGCU and you ever see me on campus , like feel free to say hi because you'll  make my day . </h1>I just got out of DSW , and I spent like 30 minutes in there because it was just such a process for them to do an exchange . </h1>And then she had to scan and go get the shoes and then she said they didn't  have the size . </h1>So I ended up having to order them , but she said there was no way to do a direct exchange . </h1>So she had to give me a return and then re-ring it up . </h1>And oh my gosh I was literally in there for like 25 minutes all to just do a simple exchange for the exact same shoe . </h1>But it's  over now and they're  gonna gon na send them to me in the mail . </h1>Hopefully they'll  be here in about a week . </h1>I'm  just kind of sad that they didn't  have them in stock , so now I have to wait . </h1>But oh well it's  over with now , we're  gonna gon na go get lunch .
