Why the Division of Labor Increases Production </h1></strong></em></br> <p>When we divide and subdivide the tasks involved with producing a good or service , workers and businesses can produce a greater quantity of output . </h1>In his observations of pin factories , Smith noticed that one worker alone might make 20 pins in a day , but that a small business of 10 workers ( some of whom would need to complete two or three of the 18 tasks involved with pin - making ) , could make 48,000 pins in a day . </h1>How can a group of workers , each specializing in certain tasks , produce so much more than the same number of workers who try to produce the entire good or service by themselves ? </h1>Smith offered three reasons . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>First , specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage . </h1>( In later chapters , we will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage . ) </h1>People have different skills , talents , and interests , so they will be better at some jobs than at others . </h1>The particular advantages may be based on educational choices , which are in turn shaped by interests and talents . </h1>Only those with medical degrees qualify to become doctors , for instance . </h1>For some goods , geography affects specialization . </h1>For example , it is easier to be a wheat farmer in North Dakota than in Florida , but easier to run a tourist hotel in Florida than in North Dakota . </h1>If you live in or near a big city , it is easier to attract enough customers to operate a successful dry cleaning business or movie theater than if you live in a sparsely populated rural area . </h1>Whatever the reason , if people specialize in the production of what they do best , they will be more effective than if they produce a combination of things , some of which they are good at and some of which they are not good at . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Second , workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality . </h1>This pattern holds true for many workers , including assembly line laborers who build cars , stylists who cut hair , and doctors who perform heart surgery . </h1>In fact , specialized workers often know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways to do their work faster and better . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>A similar pattern often operates within businesses . </h1>In many cases , a business that focuses on one product or a few products ( sometimes called its “ core competency ” ) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Third , specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale , which means that for many goods , as the level of production increases , the average cost of producing each individual unit declines . </h1>For example , if a factory produces only 100 cars per year , each car will be quite expensive to make on average . </h1>However , if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year , then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines and workers performing specialized tasks , and the average cost of production per car will be lower . </h1>The ultimate result of workers who can focus on their preferences and talents , learn to do their specialized jobs better , and work in larger organizations is that society as a whole can produce and consume far more than if each person tried to produce all of his or her own goods and services . </h1>The division and specialization of labor has been a force against the problem of scarcity .
