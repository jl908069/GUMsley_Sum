<h1>Wikinews interviews Christopher Hill , U.S. Republican Party presidential candidate </h1><h1>Interview </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>WilliamSSaturn:</b></br> <p>What qualifications do you have that will assist you in executing the duties of president ? </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>ChristopherHill:</b></br> <p>My Presidential qualifications are rooted in my service as an Officer in the United States Air Force . </h1>I took the Oath to our Constitution at 22 years old . </h1>I understood it was an Oath to ALL of our people . </h1>Politicians profess an Oath to this nation but once in office pursue their party agenda and reward their voters . </h1>As President , I will serve ALL of the people in America , guided by the Constitution . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>WilliamSSaturn:</b></br> <p>Why run for president ? </h1>Why not run for a lower office that you would be more likely to win and effect change ? </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>ChristopherHill:</b></br> <p>When I was a young man in Air Force ROTC I was chosen to attend a unique Pilot Training Program called Euro- NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training . </h1>The Air Force only selected 180 Officers a year from the Academy , Squadron Officer School and ROTC to attend . </h1>I volunteered for that program because I knew I wanted to be a Fighter Pilot and at the " Top of the Spear . " </h1>In those days it was all or nothing . </h1>If you graduated you were assigned a fighter , if you were not quite fighter pilot material you had no response to fly another aircraft , you were washed out . </h1>Congress has proven itself ineffective as a body . </h1>To make a difference in America you must have the " Bully Pulpit " and speak to the People . </h1>The President has that pulpit . </h1>All or nothing . </h1>I never wanted to make politics a career . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>WilliamSSaturn:</b></br> <p>Why did you choose to run in the Republican Party ? </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>ChristopherHill:</b></br> <p>My ties to the Republican party date back to 1979 , when I volunteered for Ronald Reagan and his campaign in New Hampshire . </h1>In those days I believed there was a difference in the parties . </h1>Today , like many Americans , I am skeptical . </h1>I understand third party candidates have no success . </h1>I hope to lead the Republican party in a new direction for working class Americans . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>WilliamSSaturn:</b></br> <p>How do you plan to get into the Republican debates and make an impact on polls ? </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>ChristopherHill:</b></br> <p>In order to be invited to the debates , we must raise money and poll nationally . </h1>This is an effort that is underway . </h1>Recently we were listed in New Hampshire and listed nationally with Politics1 . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>WilliamSSaturn:</b></br> <p>If you do not receive the Republican nomination , would you consider running as a third party candidate ? </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>ChristopherHill:</b></br> <p>No , I will back the nominee of the Republican party in 2016 . </h1>After that , I may reconsider . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>WilliamSSaturn:</b></br> <p>Other than yourself , which candidates have you supported for president in previous campaigns ? </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>ChristopherHill:</b></br> <p>I supported Reagan in 80 and 84 , supported [ George H.
