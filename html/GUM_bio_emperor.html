<h1>Emperor Norton </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Joshua Abraham Norton ( c. 1818 – January 8 , 1880 ) , known as Emperor Norton , was a citizen of San Francisco , California , who in 1859 proclaimed himself " Norton I , Emperor of the United States " . </h1>He later expanded his pretense by claiming to be " Protector of Mexico " as well . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Born in England , Norton spent most of his early life in South Africa . </h1>After the death of his mother in 1846 and the death of his father in 1848 , he sailed west , arriving in San Francisco possibly in November 1849 . </h1>Norton initially made a living as a businessman , but he lost his fortune investing in Peruvian rice . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>After he lost a lawsuit in which he tried to void his rice contract , Norton's Norton 's public prominence faded . </h1>He reemerged in September 1859 , laying claim to the position of Emperor of the United States . </h1>He had no political power , and his influence extended only so far as he was humored by those around him ; </h1>nevertheless , he was treated deferentially in San Francisco , and currency issued in his name was honored in the establishments he frequented . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Though some considered him insane or eccentric , citizens of San Francisco celebrated his regal presence and his proclamations , such as his order that the United States Congress be dissolved by force and his numerous decrees calling for a bridge connecting San Francisco to Oakland , and a corresponding tunnel to be built under San Francisco Bay . </h1>Long after his death , similar structures were built in the form of the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge and the Transbay Tube , and there have been campaigns to rename the bridge " The Emperor Norton Bridge " . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>On January 8 , 1880 , Norton collapsed at the corner of California and Dupont ( now Grant ) streets and died before he could be given medical treatment . </h1>Nearly 30,000 people packed the streets of San Francisco to pay him homage at his funeral . </h1>Norton has been immortalized as the basis of characters in the literature of writers Mark Twain , Robert Louis Stevenson , Christopher Moore , Morris and Goscinny , Selma Lagerlöf , and Neil Gaiman . <br><em><strong>Norton I , Emperor of the United States , photograph , c. 1871 – 72 </em><strong> <h1>Declares himself emperor </h1><em><strong>Emperor Joshua Norton , in full military regalia , circa 1880 or earlier </strong></em> <br> <p>By 1859 , Norton had become completely disgruntled with what he considered the inadequacies of the legal and political structures of the United States . On September 17 , 1859 , he took matters into his own hands and distributed letters to the various newspapers in the city , proclaiming himself " Emperor of these United States " : </p> <p>At the peremptory request and desire of a large majority of the citizens of these United States , I , Joshua Norton , formerly of Algoa Bay , Cape of Good Hope , and now for the last 9 years and 10 months past of S. F. , Cal. , declare and proclaim myself Emperor of these U. S. ; </h1>and in virtue of the authority thereby in me vested , do hereby order and direct the representatives of the different States of the Union to assemble in Musical Hall , of this city , on the 1st day of Feb. next , then and there to make such alterations in the existing laws of the Union as may ameliorate the evils under which the country is laboring , and thereby cause confidence to exist , both at home and abroad , in our stability and integrity . </p> <p>— NORTON I , Emperor of the United States . </p> <p>The announcement was first reprinted for humorous effect by the editor of the San Francisco Bulletin . </h1>Norton would later add " Protector of Mexico " to this title . </h1>Thus commenced his unprecedented and whimsical 21 - year " reign " over America . </h1><br></br><em><strong>One of Norton's Norton 's undated proclamations </h1></strong></em></br> <p>In his self - appointed role of emperor , Norton issued numerous decrees on matters of the state . </h1>After assuming absolute control over the country , he saw no further need for a legislature , and on October 12 , 1859 , he issued a decree formally abolishing the United States Congress . </h1>In it , Norton observed : </h1></strong></em></br> <p>... fraud and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the public voice ; </h1>that open violation of the laws are constantly occurring , caused by mobs , parties , factions and undue influence of political sects ; </h1>that the citizen has not that protection of person and property which he is entitled . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Norton ordered all interested parties to assemble at Platt's Platt 's Music Hall in San Francisco in February 1860 to " remedy the evil complained of " . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>In an imperial decree the following month , Norton summoned the Army to depose the elected officials of the U.S. Congress : </h1></strong></em></br> <p>WHEREAS , a body of men calling themselves the National Congress are now in session in Washington City , in violation of our Imperial edict of the 12th of October last , declaring the said Congress abolished ; </h1></strong></em></br> <p>WHEREAS , it is necessary for the repose of our Empire that the said decree should be strictly complied with ; </h1></strong></em></br> <p>NOW , THEREFORE , we do hereby Order and Direct Major - General Scott , the Command - in - Chief of our Armies , immediately upon receipt of this , our Decree , to proceed with a suitable force and clear the Halls of Congress .
