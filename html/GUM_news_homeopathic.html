<h1>Parents prosecuted after homeopathic treatment leads to daughter's  death </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Friday , May 8 , 2009 </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Thomas Sam , 42 , and his wife Manju Sam , 36 , from Sydney , Australia , are undergoing trial for manslaughter by gross negligence for the death of their nine - month - old child , Gloria . </h1>She died from infection caused by severe eczema after they shunned effective conventional medical treatments for homeopathy , a form of alternative medicine that has been described as pseudoscience . </h1>Articles in peer - reviewed academic journals including Social Science & Medicine have characterized homeopathy as a form of quackery . </h1><br></br><em><strong>An example of severe eczema . </h1>Image : Jambula . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Gloria developed severe eczema at the age of four months and the parents were advised to send the child to a skin specialist . </h1>Thomas Sam , a practising homeopath , instead decided to treat his daughter himself . </h1>His daughter's  condition deteriorated , to the point that the baby spent all her energy battling the infections caused by the constant breaking of the skin , leading to severe malnutrition and , eventually , her death . </h1>By the end , Gloria's  eczema was so severe that her skin broke every time her parents changed her clothes or nappy , and in the words of the Crown prosecutor , Mark Tedeschi , QC , " Gloria spent a lot of the last five months of her life crying , irritable , scratching and the only thing that gave her solace was to suck on her mother's  breast . " </h1>Gloria also became unable to move her legs . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Mr. Tedeschi also told the court that , over the last five months of her life , " Gloria's  eczema played a devastating role in her overall health and it is asserted by the Crown that both her parents knew this and discussed it with each other . " </h1>However , despite their child's  severe illness , and her lack of improvement , the Sams continued to shun conventional medical treatment , instead seeking help from other homeopaths and naturopaths . </h1>Gloria temporarily improved during the rare times they used conventional treatments , but they soon dropped them in favour of homeopathy , and she consistently worsened . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Allegedly , Thomas' Thomas ' sister pleaded with him to send Gloria to a conventional medical doctor , but he replied " I am not able to do that " . </h1>The parents are also accused of putting their social life ahead of their child , taking her on a trip to India and leaving her to servants while embarking on a busy social schedule , and giving her homeopathic drops instead of using the prescription creams they had been given . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Gloria was finally taken to the emergency department shortly before her death . </h1>By this time , " her skin was weeping , her body malnourished and her corneas melting " , according to the Sydney Morning Herald . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Speaking in the parents' parents ' defense , Tom Molomby , SC , said that , as the parents came from India , where homeopathy is in common use , they should be declared not guilty due to cultural differences . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine which treats patients with massively diluted forms of substances that , if given to a healthy person undiluted , would cause symptoms similar to the disease . </h1>Typical treatments take the dilutions , with ritualised shaking between each step of the dilution , past the level where any molecules of the original substance are likely to remain ; for homeopathic treatments to work , basic well - understood concepts in chemistry and physics would have to be wrong . </h1>There is no evidence that homeopathy is more effective than placebo for any condition .
