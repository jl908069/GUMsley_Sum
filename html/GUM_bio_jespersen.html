<h1>Otto Jespersen </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Jens Otto Harry Jespersen or Otto Jespersen ( Danish : [ ʌtˢo ˈjɛsb̥ɐsn̩ ] ; 16 July 1860 – 30 April 1943 ) was a Danish linguist who specialized in the grammar of the English language . </h1><h1>Early life </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Otto Jespersen was born in Randers in Jutland . </h1>He was inspired by the work of Danish philologist Rasmus Rask as a boy , and with the help of Rask's  grammars taught himself some Icelandic , Italian , and Spanish . </h1>He entered the University of Copenhagen in 1877 when he was 17 , initially studying law but not forgetting his language studies . </h1>In 1881 he shifted his focus completely to languages , and in 1887 earned his master's  degree in French , with English and Latin as his secondary languages . </h1>He supported himself during his studies through part - time work as a schoolteacher and as a shorthand reporter in the Danish parliament . </h1>In 1887 – 1888 , he traveled to England , Germany and France , meeting linguists like Henry Sweet and Paul Passy and attending lectures at institutions like Oxford University . </h1>Following the advice of his mentor Vilhelm Thomsen , he returned to Copenhagen in August 1888 and began work on his doctoral dissertation on the English case system . </h1>He successfully defended his dissertation in 1891 . </h1><h1>Academic life and work </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Jespersen was a professor of English at the University of Copenhagen from 1893 to 1925 , and served as Rector of the university in 1920 – 21 . </h1>His early work focused primarily on language teaching reform and on phonetics , but he is best known for his later work on syntax and on language development . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>He advanced the theories of Rank and Nexus in Danish in two papers : Sprogets logik ( 1913 ) and De to hovedarter af grammatiske forbindelser ( 1921 ) . </h1>Jespersen in this theory of ranks removes the parts of speech from the syntax , and differentiates between primaries , secondaries , and tertiaries ; e.g. in " well honed phrase , " " phrase " is a primary , this being defined by a secondary , " honed " , which again is defined by a tertiary " well " . </h1>The term Nexus is applied to sentences , structures similar to sentences and sentences in formation , in which two concepts are expressed in one unit ; e.g. , it rained , he ran indoors . </h1>This term is qualified by a further concept called a junction which represents one idea , expressed by means of two or more elements , whereas a nexus combines two ideas . </h1>Junction and nexus proved valuable in bringing the concept of context to the forefront of the attention of the world of linguistics . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>He was most widely recognized for some of his books . </h1>Language : Its Nature , Development and Origin ( 1922 ) is considered by many to be his masterpiece . </h1>Modern English Grammar on Historical Principles ( 1909 – 1949 ) , concentrated on morphology and syntax , and Growth and Structure of the English Language ( 1905 ) is a comprehensive view of English by someone with another native language , and still in print , over 70 years after his death and more than 100 years after publication . </h1>Late in his life he published Analytic Syntax ( 1937 ) , in which he presents his views on syntactic structure using an idiosyncratic shorthand notation . </h1>In The Philosophy of Grammar ( 1924 ) he challenged the accepted views of common concepts in Grammar and proposed corrections to the basic definitions of grammatical case , pronoun , object , voice etc. , and developed further his notions of Rank and Nexus . </h1>In the 21st century this book is still used as one of the basic texts in modern Structural linguistics . </h1>Mankind , Nation and Individual : from a linguistic point of view ( 1925 ) is one of the pioneering works on Sociolinguistics . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Jespersen visited the United States twice : </h1>he lectured at the Congress of Arts and Sciences in St. Louis in 1904 , and in 1909 – 1910 he visited both the University of California and Columbia University . </h1>While in the U.S. , he took occasion to study the country's  educational system . </h1>His autobiography ( see below ) was published in English translation as recently as 1995 . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Jespersen was a proponent of phonosemanticism and wrote : </h1></strong></em></br> <p>“ Is there really much more logic in the opposite extreme which denies any kind of sound symbolism ( apart from the small class of evident echoisms and ‘ onomatopoeia ’ ) and sees in our words only a collection of accidental and irrational associations of sound and meaning ? ... </h1>There is no denying that there are words which we feel instinctively to be adequate to express the ideas they stand for . ” </h1></strong></em></br> <p>After his retirement in 1925 , Jespersen remained active in the international linguistic community . </h1>In addition to continuing to write , he convened and chaired the first International Meeting on Linguistic Research in Geneva in 1930 , and acted as president of the Fourth International Congress of Linguists in Copenhagen in 1936 . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Jespersen was an important figure in the international language movement . </h1>He was an early supporter of the Esperanto offshoot Ido and in 1927 published his own project Novial . </h1>He also worked with the International Auxiliary Language Association . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Jespersen received honorary degrees from Columbia University in New York ( 1910 ) , St. Andrews University in Scotland ( 1925 ) , and the Sorbonne in Paris ( 1927 ) . </h1>He was one of the first six international scholars to be elected as honorary members of the Linguistic Society of America .
