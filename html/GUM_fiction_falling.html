<h1>Falling </h1></strong></em></br> <p>You’re  on the 236th - level Kaiserstrasse moving sidewalk when you see her . </h1>You’re  leaning on the railing , waiting to ask Derya about a job , watching the glittering stream of mites that arc over half the sky — flying up to rewind their nanosprings in the stratospheric sunlight , flying down to make Frankfurt run . </h1>You never get tired of watching them . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>She’s  on the Holbeinsteg bridge . </h1>Someone’s  hung it up here — a hundred meters of clean gray and green twentieth - century modernism , plucked up from the river Main and suspended in the chilly air 2,360 meters up , between a lump of wooded parkland and a cluster of antique subway cars . </h1>She’s  wearing a 1950s sundress and a broad - brimmed hat , and it’s  like an essay on the last century — the austere steel bridge , the bright blobs of subway graffiti , and her yellow dress , flapping against her legs as she climbs over the bridge’s  rail . </h1>A picture of elegance and style from the age of money , violence , and simplicity . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>She’s  a strawberry blonde , slim , her skin blank and virginal as new butter . </h1>She’s  beyond the rail now , hanging out over the mountain - high drop . </h1>Thin translucent shadows move across her — the shadows of the neosilk - and - nanotube filaments that hang the city from the hundreds of five - kilometer - high towers that encircle it . </h1>( A civic agent notices you noticing , and attaches itself to your infospace , whispering statistics — </h1>“ Each object’s  suspension must weather a class 5 hurricane and the destruction of 80 % of the towers ” — </h1>“ Frankfurt’s  current population is stable at 53 million ” — </h1>“ Average age 62 , birth rate 0.22 , net immigration of half a million a year ” — </h1>“ Current personal squatright : 311 cubic meters per resident ” — </h1>until you brush it away . ) </h1></strong></em></br> <p>You’re  watching her lean out . </h1>The wind whips her hair , ruffles the skirt around her knees . </h1>She must be a tourist . </h1>You remember your first trip to the upper levels : leaning over the edge into the angry swarm of mites , whirring and buzzing warnings and shoving you back like a million mosquito chaperones . </h1>Everyone tries it once — Except that there aren’t  any mites around her . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>You clutch the railing . </h1>Hot , animal fear surges in your chest . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>She looks up at you and , across the gap of forty meters , smiles a brilliant , heartbreaking smile . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Then she lets go and falls . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>You scream . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>Derya:</b></br> <p>“ Fucking airsurfers , ” says Derya . </h1>He steps off the moving sidewalk near you : tall , hook - nosed , the fashionable whorls of pox and acne making constellations of his cheeks and chest ; the glowing , formal tattoos of his committees and lifebrands adorning his massive triceps . </h1>You swallow on a dry throat . </h1>Derya , of all people , hearing you scream ! </h1></strong></em></br> <p>He gives you a hooded look . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>“ They infect themselves with some designer virus - </h1>it lets them hack the city’s  person - recognition systems . </h1>So the mites don’t  see them when they jump . </h1>Watch — ” </h1></strong></em></br> <p>She’s  swept past the whalelike oval of the public pool on the 202nd , past the sloping mandala of the Google of offices on the 164th . </h1>At the 131st , below her , is the old Stock Exchange , hung upside - down now as a hipster den . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Now the mites are finally closing in . </h1>A silver swarm coalesces around the 164th , and she vanishes into it , like a snip of scallion vanishes into cloudy miso soup . </h1>When the cloud disperses , she’s  standing on one of the Stock Exchange’s  upside - down overhangs . </h1>She waves , antlike , then crawls through a dormer window . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>“ It’s  not funny , ” Derya says . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>“ They’re  a huge drain on emergency preparedness . </h1>Ripple effects are causing project slowdowns ... ” </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>Protagonist:</b></br> <p>“ Freeloaders drive systemic evolution , ” you find yourself saying . </h1></strong></em></br> <br><b>Derya:</b></br> <p>“ Don’t  you quote the founders at me , ” Derya snaps . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>“ The Free Society is fragile . </h1>The minute enough people find anticontributive behavior cool , the party’s  over — </h1>it’s  back to capitalist competition or state control . ” </h1>He stares until you meet his eye . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>“ You even talk to those people - </h1>are you paying attention ? — </h1>you even talk to them , your rep will be trashed on all the major servers . </h1>You won’t  work , you won’t  party , you’ll  be defriended by every one of your tribes . </h1>Got it ? ” </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Her broad - brimmed hat is still sailing on the wind . </h1>The mites missed it . </h1>It cuts between the towers of the 50th . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>The upside - down trading floor is deserted . </h1>There are heaps of yellowed euros and deutschmarks dumped here , like snowdrifts . </h1>Wood panel , marble . </h1>Silence . </h1>And the air is strangely clear . </h1>You realize : no mites . </h1>The city has no eyes or ears here . </h1>You walk through empty , miteless rooms , stepping around light fixtures . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Then she’s  there , in a doorway . </h1>Her eyes , bright blue , radiant . </h1>Her smile , with that chaste yellow dress , so bashful . </h1>She comes to you . </h1><br><br><b>Woman:</b></br> “ You want it ? ” she says . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>“ You want to be infected ? </h1>You want to fly ? ” </h1></strong></em></br> <p>You nod . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Eyes closing , she leans in for the kiss .
