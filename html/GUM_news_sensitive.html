<h1>Sensitive Canadian document found on rainy streets </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Friday , August 15 , 2008 </h1></strong></em></br> <p>A sensitive Environment Canada document was found wet on an Ottawa street by someone who gave it to the CBC today . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>The 131 - page document was found on Castlefrank Road in Kanata , Ontario in a rain - stained , tire - marked brown envelope by a passerby . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>The document which had the stamp Protected B on every page detailed various security vulnerabilities of the NEMISIS database which is used by officers to track and prosecute environmental law - breakers . </h1>If someone were able to shut the system down , or hack inside and delete or corrupt the information , it could affect the prosecution of the lawbreakers . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>The database was unveiled in 1999 as the National Enforcement Management Information System and Intelligence System . </h1>However , on the document , it referred to the database as National Enforcement and Emergency Management Information System and Intelligence System , adding the words " and Emergency " to the name . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Protection B documents are the second lowest grade of classified government documents . </h1>Environment Canada spokesperson Julie Hahn said they apply to letters of complaint , criticism or injury , research or scientific notes and findings that don`t do n`t have any conclusion , and Treasury Board letters , agendas and minutes that don`t do n`t deal with subjects of national interest . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Environment Minister John Baird has asked government officials how such documents that are supposed to be stored in " approved security cabinets " wound up on the street . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>" I'm I 'm told two things : that it's it 's neither classified nor secret and that it's it 's stuff that could be available under access to information , " Baird said . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Environment Canada spokeswoman Sujata Raisinghani told CBC News the department will look into the incident . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>" We take document security seriously , " she said , but refused to give any more details about how the papers came to be on a road . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Paul Dewar , an Ottawa New Democrat MP , said the combined security lapses raise serious questions about the government's government 's ability to secure sensitive documents . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Dewar says that bureaucrats of the Conservative government have complained to him about document security to the point that they can`t ca n`t share the information with their own colleagues . </h1>However , when a government document has been found on the streets , the government then says it wasn't was n't particularly sensitive . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>" This government is so consumed with control of information and secrecy yet they don't do n't seem to be able to get the fundamentals right , " Dewar said . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>The incident is a reminiscent of two other incidents . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>In March , a bundle of blueprints for a new headquarters for the military's military 's counterterrorism unit were found stuffed in the trash on a downtown street . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>In May , Maxime Bernier was forced to resign as Foreign Affairs minister after it became known that he left sensitive documents at the apartment of his then - girlfriend Julie Couillard who had ties to the Hells Angels biker gang . </h1><h1>Sources </h1><br></br> " Sensitive government document found on rainy Ottawa street " — CBC.ca , August 15 , 2008 </h1></strong></em></br> <p>" Document found on street not secret , say feds " — The Canadian Press , August 15 , 2008 </h1></strong></em></br> <p>" Environment Canada security report found on street " — Toronto Star , August 15 , 2008 </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Peter Zimonjic . </h1>" MP calls for probe into misplaced documents " — Edmonton Sun , August 16 , 2008 </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Categories : </h1>August 15 , 2008 </h1>Canada </h1>Published </h1>North America </h1>Politics and conflicts </h1>Environment Canada </h1>Archived
