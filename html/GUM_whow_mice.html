<h1>How to Get Rid of Mice Naturally </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Having mice in your home is both a nuisance and a health hazard . </h1>They can cause property damage , create a mess , and produce unpleasant smells . </h1>In addition , repelling and removing rodents from your home can be a hassle if you don't do n't know what you are doing . </h1>It can also be dangerous if you use toxic chemicals and poisons . </h1>It's It 's a good thing , then , that there are some simple ways to effectively get mice out of your home without the use of toxic chemicals and poisons . </h1><h1>Method 1 Discouraging Mice Naturally </h1><br></br> Keep your home clean . </h1>Many times mice are drawn into homes on the search for food . </h1>If there is nothing to eat , mice will be less likely to stay . </h1>Keep all food stored properly in airtight containers or in places that are safe from mouse attack . [ 1 ] </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Apply peppermint oil . </h1>Peppermint oil is a natural deterrent . </h1>The smell is simply too intense for rodents and they will not try to go near it . </h1>It also helps to mask the scent of any tasty morsels that have been missed when cleaning . </h1>It also gives the house a lovely smell , and is not toxic , unlike many synthetic chemical treatments . </h1>You can get peppermint oil in most health food stores and even some major grocery stores . [ 2 ] </h1><br></br> Place a drop or two on a cotton ball . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Place a cotton ball under or near your garbage can to deter mice from getting into it . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Place the cotton balls in areas where mice are likely to enter your house , by doorways , or heat vents , etc. </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Peppermint oil cotton balls need to be replaced after 5 - 7 days , depending upon the quantity of oil you put on it . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Try growing peppermint plants near the entryways . </h1>You can use the mint in cooking , as well as it serving a deterrent purpose . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Use dried snake feces . </h1>Visit a local reptile center , zoo , or pet store and ask for some dried snake poo . </h1>You can also sometimes find someone who owns a pet snake . </h1>Place near entrances and in places where mice seem to go . </h1>This will keep mice away . [ 3 ] </h1><br></br> Be sure to keep the feces out of the reach of children and pets . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Zap mice with ultrasonic sounds . </h1>There are electronic units sold that emit an ultrasonic beeping sound that rodents hate . </h1>They should be available at your local home improvement store or online . </h1><br></br> These work only on a single line of sight , so you need to know the exact path the mice are taking . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>The units may only work for a short time because mice can become used to them . [ 4 ] </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Use a commercial , organic deterrent . </h1>Many companies that specialize in organic garden and home products make mice repellents that are better for the environment than traditional poisons . </h1>Many of these products use natural ingredients , such as peppermint , that are known to be disagreeable to mice . </h1>They will not kill mice but they should keep them out of areas where the product is applied . </h1><br></br> These products should be available at your local gardening or home improvement center . </h1>If you want a specific product , try doing a online search to see where it is available locally . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Get a cat . </h1>A house cat can take care of the problem . </h1>Cats that spend time outdoors are more likely to hunt to find their own food and may track down that mouse . </h1>Just be aware , not all cats have enough energy , interest or training to hunt mice . </h1>Kittens typically have to be taught by the mother to easily become a mouser . </h1>Well - food indoor kitties might just see the mouse as a toy , and grow quickly bored of it after scaring it half witless . </h1><br></br> Shelters and adoption agencies often do not know if a cat is a good mouse hunter , and generally do not test for this . </h1>Sometimes this information is available , but usually not . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>While many mousers are great pets as well , not all are . </h1>" Barn cats " may not be socialized well with humans , although used to hunting mice for food . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Even if you do not have a cat , you can use used kitty litter to deter mice . </h1>Place tubs of used kitty litter around entrances of the house . </h1>The mice will sniff the smell of cat urine and clear off in a jiffy . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>If you have a large infestation , a cat may not be enough to totally get rid of it . </h1>However , once you eliminate the infestation , a cat will probably prevent reinfestation . [ 5 ] </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Put your trash cans far from your home . </h1>Mice smell garbage and get attracted to your house . </h1>If you keep the cans away from the house , they are less likely to take up residence in your home . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Promote the nesting of birds of prey in your yard . </h1>Build a shelter box in your garden to attract some onto your property . </h1>This may take some time , but it's it 's worth the effort if you can attract a wild mouse eater to your yard . [ 6 ] </h1><br></br> Make sure the shelter box has no nails or safety hazards . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>A barn owl is the best . </h1>A family of barn owls can eat many mice in a night ! </h1>However , you might attract other types of owls or birds of prey with your nesting box .
