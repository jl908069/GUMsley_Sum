<br><b>Anjabe96:</b></br> ELI5 : </h1>If every major country is in billions ( if not trillions ) of debt , where are they borrowing from ? </h1><br><b>CChoe:</b></br> You can borrow from your own people . </h1>The money that is printed is FEDERAL RESERVE ( thanks for the corrections ) notes -- it's  technically a debt that the Reserve owes the bearer of the note ( but printing money does not technically increase the debt supply -- the role of money has changed since fiat currency ) . <br></br> </h1>When you print more money , you are devaluing the rest of the currency that is already in circulation . </h1>This means that if the govt decided to print $ 100,000,000,000,000,000 ( 1 quadrillion dollars ) in the span of a week , the value of the dollar would probably crash pretty hard ( probably ... ) . </h1>This is related because people use money to buy US debt --  loaning the US govt the very money it prints . </h1>The only reason that this results in anything favorable is because people all over the world value USD and that paper currency represents potential labor , new assets , etc. <br></br> </h1>If you own a baseball card of Sammy Sosa , there is a chance it could be worth a lot of money . </h1>Now imagine if the card company just mails a Sammy Sosa card to every family in America . </h1>Your Sammy Sosa card isn't  worth anything anymore because there are so many of them and everyone has it now . </h1>Now imagine if they mailed another 5 to everyone -- the value crashes even harder because there are SO many of them now . </h1> <br></br>That's  the same idea with money . </h1>You can't  keep printing more money or else the value of it will deteriorate . </h1>But the gov't keeps issuing more debt and we still look at $ 20 like it's  $ 20 , right ? </h1>Eventually , there could come a time when we look at a $ 20 bill and it means nothing to us . </h1> <br> </br>This is what happened in Zimbabwe where a billion dollar transaction might happen for a loaf of bread . </h1>They printed so much money ( without proper secure backing by the gov't ) that it just became worthless . </h1>So they started to just increase the numbers on their currency so you can actually pay for something . </h1> <br></br>Because the gov't theoretically owes its population money , they issue paper as a certificate of this . </h1>You might not have physically went to the bank and traded something in return for paper but you did something that warranted the earning of that dollar . </h1>If you work for a company , they pay you that money because it has value and you can buy things with it . </h1> <br></br>The only reason it has value is because the US gov't says it does . </h1>You can pay gov't-related fees and bills with the money they issue and because the gov't is well-secured , people accept it . </h1>If our gov't was unstable , no one would trust the dollars they slept under for warmth because the gov't could just come out and say , ' Sorry  not paying you guys back ' . </h1> <br></br>Well what would they be paying back ? </h1>To whom are they paying back to ? </h1> <br></br>It used to be gold . </h1>But as we grew as a planet , we ran out of gold to back every dollar with and it just became a nightmare to handle . </h1>Enter , fiat currency , a piece of paper that means nothing except what the gov't says it means . </h1> <br></br>People used to go to banks with gold and receive ' money ' for it . </h1>The banks would literally hold their gold and give them an certificate that says they own a claim of gold in their vaults . </h1>If ANYONE brought that certificate to the bank , they could expect to receive gold for it . </h1>That's  what gave it value . </h1> <br></br>You could say you want that farmer's  potatoes and he can go get $ 1 of gold from the bankers at his convenience or he could hold onto it and use it just like the person did before him -- ' trade ' it for something else like new shoes . </h1>Why ? </h1>Because everyone liked gold and everyone believed gold had value . </h1> <br></br>Eventually , this took off and people stopped trading for things and we developed currency with quantitative values that allowed for easy exchanges to take place . </h1> <br></br>So you might think , ' Well , now that there isn't  gold behind my dollar , how is it worth anything even if the gov't say it is ? They won't  give me anything in return for it " . </h1> <br></br>The same thing applies to gold . </h1>No one wants gold unless other people want gold . </h1>If you can't  reasonably trade your gold for something else , then what value does it have ? </h1>( Someone did point out you can shave gold flakes into your water and drink it , like some companies have chosen to do , but that's  on you ) </h1> <br></br>As long as people continue to value dollars , it doesn't  matter what it's  worth , sans some certain supply and demand laws . </h1>So gold is no different in that regard . </h1>The ONE difference between paper currency and gold is that $ 100,000 in cash weighs a lot less than $ 100,000 in gold and is a lot easier to hide too . </h1> <br></br>EDIT : </h1>I made some slight revisions to correct errors and to try and relate things better to the main topic at hand . </h1>Sorry , I kinda started rambling . </h1>I have also posted below in response to u/penny_eater to correct my errors and explain them in a little bit further detail but it kinda strays away from ELI5 territory . <br></br> </h1>This kinda seems all over the place but it should be good starter information for someone trying to understand debt markets and macroeconomics , in general . </h1>Monetary supply and debt are pretty hand-in-hand , even if  not exactly the same thing . </h1> <br></br>Larger and more complex economies warranted the development of fiat currency which ultimately changed the role of currency , in general . </h1>It no longer represents a claim , per se , but it represents value because the gov't says it has value and will accept it for gov't related transactions and business with foreign entities . </h1> <br></br>Also , don't  get me started on the petrodollar .
