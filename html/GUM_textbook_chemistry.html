<h1>2.1 Early Ideas in Atomic Theory </h1></strong></em></br> <p>By the end of this section , you will be able to : </h1><br></br> State the postulates of Dalton’s  atomic theory </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Use postulates of Dalton’s  atomic theory to explain the laws of definite and multiple proportions </h1></strong></em></br> <p>The earliest recorded discussion of the basic structure of matter comes from ancient Greek philosophers , the scientists of their day . </h1>In the fifth century BC , Leucippus and Democritus argued that all matter was composed of small , finite particles that they called atomos , a term derived from the Greek word for “ indivisible . ” </h1>They thought of atoms as moving particles that differed in shape and size , and which could join together . </h1>Later , Aristotle and others came to the conclusion that matter consisted of various combinations of the four “ elements ” — fire , earth , air , and water — and could be infinitely divided . </h1>Interestingly , these philosophers thought about atoms and “ elements ” as philosophical concepts , but apparently never considered performing experiments to test their ideas . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>The Aristotelian view of the composition of matter held sway for over two thousand years , until English schoolteacher John Dalton helped to revolutionize chemistry with his hypothesis that the behavior of matter could be explained using an atomic theory . </h1>First published in 1807 , many of Dalton’s  hypotheses about the microscopic features of matter are still valid in modern atomic theory . </h1>Here are the postulates of Dalton’s  atomic theory . </h1><br></br> 1. Matter is composed of exceedingly small particles called atoms . </h1>An atom is the smallest unit of an element that can participate in a chemical change . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>2. An element consists of only one type of atom , which has a mass that is characteristic of the element and is the same for all atoms of that element ( Figure 2.2 ) . </h1>A macroscopic sample of an element contains an incredibly large number of atoms , all of which have identical chemical properties . </h1><br></br><em><strong>Figure 2.2 </h1>A pre-1982 copper penny ( left ) contains approximately 3 ×× 10 22 copper atoms ( several dozen are represented as brown spheres at the right ) , each of which has the same chemical properties . </h1>( credit : modification of work by “ slgckgc ” / Flickr ) </h1></strong></em></br> <p>3. Atoms of one element differ in properties from atoms of all other elements . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>4. A compound consists of atoms of two or more elements combined in a small , whole - number ratio . </h1>In a given compound , the numbers of atoms of each of its elements are always present in the same ratio ( Figure 2.3 ) . </h1><br></br><em><strong>Figure 2.3 </h1>Copper(II) oxide , a powdery , black compound , results from the combination of two types of atoms — copper ( brown spheres ) and oxygen ( red spheres ) — in a 1 : 1 ratio . </h1>( credit : modification of work by “ Chemicalinterest ” / Wikimedia Commons ) </h1></strong></em></br> <p>5. Atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change , but are instead rearranged to yield substances that are different from those present before the change ( Figure 2.4 ) . </h1><br></br><em><strong>Figure 2.4 </h1>When the elements copper ( a shiny , red - brown solid , shown here as brown spheres ) and oxygen ( a clear and colorless gas , shown here as red spheres ) react , their atoms rearrange to form a compound containing copper and oxygen ( a powdery , black solid ) . </h1>( credit copper : modification of work by http://images-of-elements.com/copper.php ) </h1></strong></em></br> <p>Dalton’s  atomic theory provides a microscopic explanation of the many macroscopic properties of matter that you’ve  learned about . </h1>For example , if an element such as copper consists of only one kind of atom , then it cannot can not be broken down into simpler substances , that is , into substances composed of fewer types of atoms . </h1>And if atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change , then the total mass of matter present when matter changes from one type to another will remain constant ( the law of conservation of matter ) . </h1><h1>EXAMPLE 2.1 </h1><h1>Testing Dalton’s  Atomic Theory </h1></strong></em></br> <p>In the following drawing , the green spheres represent atoms of a certain element . </h1>The purple spheres represent atoms of another element . </h1>If the spheres touch , they are part of a single unit of a compound . </h1>Does the following chemical change represented by these symbols violate any of the ideas of Dalton’s  atomic theory ? </h1>If so , which one ? </h1><h1>Solution </h1></strong></em></br> <p>The starting materials consist of two green spheres and two purple spheres . </h1>The products consist of only one green sphere and one purple sphere . </h1>This violates Dalton’s  postulate that atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change , but are merely redistributed . </h1>( In this case , atoms appear to have been destroyed . ) </h1><h1>Check Your Learning </h1></strong></em></br> <p>In the following drawing , the green spheres represent atoms of a certain element . </h1>The purple spheres represent atoms of another element . </h1>If the spheres touch , they are part of a single unit of a compound . </h1>Does the following chemical change represented by these symbols violate any of the ideas of Dalton’s  atomic theory ? </h1>If so , which one ? </h1><h1>ANSWER : </h1></strong></em></br> <p>The starting materials consist of four green spheres and two purple spheres . </h1>The products consist of four green spheres and two purple spheres . </h1>This does not violate any of Dalton’s  postulates : </h1>Atoms are neither created nor destroyed , but are redistributed in small , whole - number ratios .
