<h1>Chapter Two : Master Lunre </h1></strong></em></br> <p>My father’s  actions were largely incomprehensible to me , guided by his own secret and labyrinthine calculations . </h1>He dwelt in another world , a world of intrigue , bargains , contracts and clandestine purchases of land all over the island . </h1>He was in many ways a world in himself , whole as a sphere . </h1>No doubt his decisions were perfectly logical in his own eyes — even the one that prompted him , a patriotic islander , to bring me a tutor from Bain : Master Lunre , an Olondrian . </h1></strong></em></br> <p>The day began as it usually did when my father was expected home from his travels , the house festooned with flowers and stocked with coconut liquor . </h1>We stood by the gate , washed and perfumed and arrayed in our brightest clothes , my mother twisting her hands in her skirt , my father’s  wife with red eyes . </h1>Jom , grown taller and broad in the shoulders , moaned gently to himself , while I stood nervously rubbing the heel of one sandal on the flagstones . </h1>We scanned the deep blue valley for the first sign of the company , but before we saw them we heard the children shouting : “ A yellow man ! ” </h1></strong></em></br> <p>A yellow man ! </h1>We glanced at one another in confusion . </h1>My mother bit her lower lip ; Jom gave a groan of alarm . </h1>At first I thought the children meant my father , whose golden skin , the color of the night - monkey’s  pelt , was a rarity in the islands ; but certainly the children of Tyom were familiar with my father , and would never have greeted a council - member with such ill - mannered yells . </h1>Then I remembered the only “ yellow man ” I had ever seen , an Olondrian wizard and doctor who had visited Tyom in my childhood , who wore two pieces of glass on his eyes , attached to his ears with wires , and roamed the hills of Tinimavet , cutting bits off the trees . </h1>I have since learned that that doctor wrote a well - received treatise , On the Medicinal Properties of the Juice of the Young Coconut , and died a respected man in his native city of Deinivel ; but at the time I felt certain he had returned with his sack of tree - cuttings . </h1> <p>“ There they are , ” said Pavit , the head house - servant , in a strained voice . </h1>And there they were : a chain of riders weaving among the trees . </h1>My father’s  plaited umbrella appeared , his still , imposing figure , and beside him another man appeared , tall and lean , astride an island mule . </h1>The hectic screams of the children preceded the company into the village , so that they advanced like a festival , drawing people out of their houses . </h1>As they approached I saw that my father’s  face was shining with pride , and his bearing had in it a new hauteur , like that of the old island kings . </h1>The man who rode beside him , looking uncomfortable with his long legs , kept his gaze lowered and fixed between the ears of his plodding mule . </h1>He was not yellow , but very pale brown , the color of raw cashews ; he had silver hair , worn cropped close to the skull so that it resembled a cap . </h1>He was not the leaf - collecting doctor , but an altogether strange man , with silver eyebrows in his smooth face and long fine - knuckled hands . </h1>As he dismounted in front of the house I heard my mother whispering : “ Protect us , God with the Black - and - White Tail , from that which is not of this earth . ” </p> </h1></strong></em></br> <p>My father dismounted from his mule and strutted toward us , grinning . </h1>I thought I caught an odor off him , of fish , sea - sickness and sweat . </h1>We knelt and stared down at the bald ground , murmuring ritual greetings , until he touched the tops of our heads with the palm of his fleshy hand . </h1>Then we stood , unable to keep from staring at the stranger , who faced us awkwardly , half - smiling , taller than any man there .
