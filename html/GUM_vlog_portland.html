</strong></em></br> <br><b>KatieBlake:</b></br> <p>Hi everyone , welcome back to my channel . </h1>My name is Katie and today I'm  going to be talking about my two and a half week long vacation to Portland , Oregon . </h1>So I am from Washington D.C. , and I have a bunch of family in Portland , Oregon , so it wasn't my first time going there . </h1>Um but it was definitely my first time , like as an adult . </h1>So that was really exciting and fun . </h1>I thought that I would make sort of like more of an informative video because I could just like post a vlog , but um the footage was like so random , and all over the place . </h1>I got some really cool footage but um , not like cute like Instagram girl footage , because I did dress like a 12 year old boy the whole time . </h1>So the first thing that I recommend you do in Portland is not actually in Portland at all . </h1>So you might be like this is a terrible list . </h1>Sorry . </h1>The number one thing that we did on our trip was we actually stayed a night in Eugene , Oregon , and we got up at like the crack of dawn and drove to Crater Lake . </h1>This was incredible . </h1>Um one of the coolest things that I have ever seen . </h1>The footage that I'm  gonna gon na put in here honestly it looks a little bit fake . </h1>This place was incredible . </h1>We didn't do a whole lot of hiking here because there was not a whole lot of cloud coverage that day , and it was so hot . </h1>So what we did was we drove around the entire perimeter of the lake and you get all these incredible views of the mountains and the lake , and seeing it from all the different angles was so worth it . </h1>So maybe this is not something that you want to do if you're  just going to Portland for a couple of days but it's  definitely something to consider if you're  going out to Oregon for a little bit longer period of time . </h1>Number two is shopping . </h1>These are in no particular order by the way . </h1>They're  just sort of like what I thought of as I was making this video . </h1>So there's  a lot of cool shopping in Portland , Oregon . </h1>A lot of cool thrifting and vintage stores , a lot of cool art galleries . </h1>And then one of the biggest things that you should check out while you're  there is Powell's  which is a bookstore . </h1>And I want to say it's  like the the biggest like Indie Indie bookstore in America . </h1>I guess that's  what it's  called . </h1>I'm  gonna gon na – oh , it's  the world's  largest independent bookstore . </h1>So this place was so cool we could have spent hours in here . </h1>The best thing that I thought about this bookstore was that they mixed in new copies of books with used copies . </h1>So if you're  looking for a book and you're  wondering like – oh I wonder if I could get this used , like it's  usually right next to it , which I thought was just like so awesome . </h1>That was very exciting for me because I love a used book . </h1>So I am not a huge like nature person . </h1>Um I don't enjoy bugs . </h1>But um I will go on a good hike from now and again so just like you know where I'm  coming from . </h1>My friend Andrea is a biology major so we did stop to look at many slugs that were on the ground and I did beeline it away from the slugs . </h1>But if you like slugs , you're  in – you're  in luck . </h1>So the first couple days we were in Portland , we went hiking in Forest Park which you can get to by public transit in the city . </h1>It's  really quick and some of the trails even pop you back out into like the city , so it's  – it's  really super accessible . </h1>So we did the Wildwood Trail and we also did a tour of Pittock Mansion . </h1>Um if you don't want to do a tour of Pittock Mansion , I'd  still recommend like taking the trail up there because it has a really cool like overlook of the city that you can go see . </h1>Um I loved doing that . </h1>So number four are the Japanese gardens and the rose gardens in Forest Park . </h1>I actually don't know if they're  like technically in Forest Park but they're  right in the same area . </h1>So the rose garden is free and open to the public and it is just huge . </h1>It's  a lot of roses as you can imagine . </h1>Um lots of tourists but it was – it was still really fun . </h1>You get to walk through all these gardens and different types of roses from different parts of the world and yeah it was just really cool . </h1>Then the Japanese gardens you do have to pay for but I will say that it was definitely worth it . </h1>If it's  a clear day you can actually see Mount Hood from the Japanese gardens which was really wild , and the garden was just so pretty and quiet and serene . </h1>There were even some people like meditating in there which was kind of funny . </h1>I did wear my bird shirt – It's  a pretty good bird shirt , I got a compliment on it – which I didn't say this earlier , but I bought this at the Audubon Society which I learned what that was . </h1>I didn't know what that was but it's  um a society for um like bird watching and bird care and um they had a shirt that said bird nerd on it so I bought it because I thought it was funny . </h1>But I was approached by – I want to say – at least three different people who asked me if I did bird watching like very seriously .
