</strong></em></br> <br><b>KharmaMedic:</b></br> <p>What is up guys ? </h1>Kharma Medic here and welcome back to another dose . </h1>So in today's today 's video , I'm I 'm finally gonna gon na be doing a room tour . </h1>I know this is something that you guys have requested for a very long time , and after two and a half years of living here , I finally feel like I've I 've made it my own and decorated it how I want , and I'm I 'm ready to show it to you guys . </h1>Alright so let's let 's start off with the bed and the couch area . </h1>Honestly , if I was redoing this from the beginning , I would have really liked to have a double bed in this room , but , unfortunately , with the space as you can probably see from that wall there till the door , it's it 's basically just enough to fit a bed and a couch , and this is my couch over here . </h1>I've I 've recently changed it , and if you've you 've been following my channel for a long time , then you'll you 'll know I'm I 'm really proud of how I color match the pictures on the wall over here with sort of the gray and yellow vibe , the gray and yellow cushions . </h1>This couch is also quite big , it fits three people quite comfortably , and if I have family or friends staying over , it opens up into a full double bed . </h1>This coffee table over here , it's it 's glass and has two levels , so it's it 's really good when we have multiple friends over , and we have lots of food to put on the table , or if we're we 're playing board games , we can have people sit around it , and still have a lot of space to lay everything out . </h1>So there's there 's nothing too special about the bed itself , but it does have a very important function , which , it has a lot of storage . </h1>So down here is basically where I keep everything that I can't ca n't really keep in my room , because there's there 's not enough space . </h1>I've I 've got an ironing board , all of my suitcases , socks , clothes that I don't do n't wear that often , anything that I need for fixing the house like screwdrivers , drills , nails , all these things that I definitely wouldn't would n't want to have laid out in my room , but I still need somewhere in the house . </h1>I love that this room has floor - to - ceiling windows as well , it really lets the light come in , especially in the summer time . </h1>I know London doesn't does n't have that much light , but I'll I 'll take as much as I can , and there's there 's also a small balcony out here , which is fairly rare for London . </h1>We have two chairs where we can sit down and sort of enjoy the weather when it is a little bit better , um but now it's it 's really cold so just gonna gon na close it . </h1>And then a little behind the scenes that you probably will never see again in a video is that down here I keep all of the filming gear that doesn't does n't really fit anywhere else in the room : two sets of tripods , I also have a c - stand . </h1>Okay next to my bed , I've I 've got the radio alarm clock , and this has actually changed my life . </h1>It makes waking up in the morning and getting out of bed at 6:00 a.m. when it's it 's pitch black outside so much easier when you're you 're waking up really early . </h1>It's It 's so much better to wake up to the sound of somebody talking to you : your favorite radio station , some music , whatever , instead of that classic iPhone alarm , " ba , ba , ba . " </h1>Over here on the wall , these are posters that I actually bought back in 2013 in my first year of university in Toronto , and I really really liked them so I've I 've kept them around . </h1>Also I'm I 'm really proud that I managed to put them up all by myself , they look quite neat , and I feel like they're they 're equally spaced , so I'm I 'm really proud of how they turned out .
