JAMIE:    Are you â€” 
			    Do they still teach at Bahia on Sunday?
        	night?

MILES:  	Oh yeah.
        	In fact I would have gone today,
        	if it wasn't for my back.
		  	  Well I finally found some people there I can dance with.
        	So that helps.

JAMIE:  	Do you need a partner?

MILES:  	To go there?

JAMIE:  	Yeah.

MILES:  	No.
        	Besides,
        	you,
        	I mean if you're a guy,
        	If --
        	If you're a woman,
        	I mean,
        	those guys'll be all over you.
        	I swear it.

JAMIE:  	Don't say that,
			    Harold's in the room.

HAROLD: 	dear,
    
JAMIE:  	You could come too.

MILES:  	Well I don't necessarily mean,
        	in a bad way,
        	even though I'm sure there are a few there,
        	I'm not dancing with guys.
        	All I can say is,
        	the women aren't all over me.
        	Darn.

HAROLD: 	Ooh.

MILES:  	But,
			    but I remember,
        	like I went there with this person,
        	it's kind of funny .
        	th- this person did not want to dance.
        	So she's just gonna watch.
        	So,
        	every once in a while I'd get up and dance,
        	and it's like,
        	when I'd come back,
        	I mean there was some guy there,
        	sitting in my chair.

MILES:  	Every time I got up.
        	I'm thinking,
        	God,
        	these guys don't waste any time.
        	I mean,
        	you turn your back,
        	and there's somebody moving in.
			    I mean I don't know if they-

JAMIE:  	Maybe Harold you should come with me.

HAROLD: 	Why?
        	So I can find --

JAMIE:  	learn some lam-  lambada.
           
HAROLD: 	find some girls with empty chairs next to em?

HAROLD: 	Maybe I should go with Miles.

MILES:  	Oh did-  --

JAMIE:  	Yeah,
        	you guys could be partners.

MILES:  	Did- --

JAMIE:  	What?

MILES:  	Well I don't know if I told you,
        	told you that story about that woman,
        	who uh,
        	went after that guy there?
        	I told you that story,
        	right?
        	I was there Sunday three  four weeks ago?
        	Uh,
        	after the class is over w- --
        	over with,
        	I'm sitting down at a table,
        	there's a woman from --
        	who was in the class,
        	and two men,
        	sitting to my right,
        	is a table with two women there.
        	They had apparently just come from Oba Oba.
        	on the last night-

JAMIE:  	Oh I think you told me.

MILES:  	the last night,

JAMIE:  	Yeah .

MILES:  	And like,
        	well they were attractive women,
        	the one had on a real real short skirt.
        	Anyway,
        	there was this guy in his fifties,
        	out there dancing,
        	by himself.
        	And the woman was just looking at him,
        	making eyes,
        	then she went out there,
        	got on her knees.
        	in front of him.
        	in this skirt that's this short,
        	takes her hands,
        	and goes along his toes,
        	and then up,
        	and is just doing like that.
        	I figured,
			    oh,
        	they must know each other.

JAMIE:  	Ooh.

HAROLD: 	very well,
        	in fact .

PETE:   	Mhm.

JAMIE:  	Gross.

MILES:  	That's what I assumed.
        	And,
        	they did that for the whole dance,
        	and I mean,
        	she was d- all kind of suggestive stuff,
        	and touching him and everything,
        	people would like . cheering,
        	and clapping,
        	"go for it" 
        	And all this kind of thing?
        	The-  the song ended,
        	the guy set down,
        	at another table.
        	And she  set down,

JAMIE:  	at a- --

MILES:  	at the table with her woman friend.
        	They never danced again the rest of the evening.

HAROLD: 	Hm.

MILES:  	This is like,

MILES:  	so I was thinking,
        	this woman's sitting about as far away from me as Jamie is.
        	And I was thinking,
        	hm,
        	this is interesting.
        	I wonder how long it was gonna take the guys in this club to move in on her.
        	No sooner did I think this thought,
        	guys were over there,
        	
HAROLD: 	What-
        	you didn't ask her to dance?

JAMIE:  	Not Miles,
        	he's just in daze .

MILES:  	Well I was still trying to figure out,

MILES:  	surely they must know each other,
        	I mean,
        	why wasn't he sitting at her table,

JAMIE:  	You mean,
        	you were still thinking about it .

MILES:  	Anyway,
        	this guy,

MILES:  	I mean he comes over there,
        	immediately afterwards,

JAMIE:  	the same guy who got his --
        	the same guy who's --

HAROLD: 	No,
        	it's just some random guy.

JAMIE:  	Or just some random guy.

MILES:  	No,
        	a random guy.
        	who was like sitting about where you are.

HAROLD: 	Yeah,

MILES:  	He was sitting there,
        	there were two guys sitting at a table right where you are.
        	And then these two women are sitting here.
        	So uh,
        	he comes over there,
        	and is talking with that woman.
        	I don't know about what,
        	but then like ten minutes later,
        	she and her friend are over at their table.
        	And then,
        	twenty minutes later,
        	they were kinda like  all over each other.
        	You know.
        	kissing,
        	et cetera,
        	et cetera.
        	And I was thinking,
        	it looks like,
        	these people aren't going home alone tonight.
        	
HAROLD: 	Gosh,

MILES:  	But I just thought that --

HAROLD: 	no wonder they forbid this dance.
        	
MILES:  	So,

JAMIE:  	Oh my God ,
        	what a story.
        	Well,
        	maybe I shouldn't go there then.
			
HAROLD: 	Yeah,
        	maybe you shouldn't .
