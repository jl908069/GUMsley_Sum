Escape The Room Employees, what is the weirdest thing you've seen someone do in one of the rooms? 

<b>Saucy_Wrench:</b>

The most depressing shit I saw was a tired looking couple who brought in their bespectacled, NASA shirt wearing, 8 year old geek of a son in to have some fun. The parents couldn't have been more discouraging to him. He was excitedly bouncing around the room pointing out things that he thought were clues clues while the parents dismissed every idea he had and told him to stop getting so excited. The parents took charge and proceeded to ignore the obvious clues he was pointing out and spent most of the time pursuing dead ends. Sad part is his instincts were more often than not correct but his parents just didn't listen and refused to let him explore and try stuff out. 

Hopefully his curiosity and enthusiasm survives them.

I feel like if it were in my power in any way, that kid would have led his parents right through the damned thing. 

<b>SmartassComment:</b>

If I were the 'operator' of that site, at the end I would have walked the family through every damn clue the kid noticed and made sure the parents knew the kid was right. 

<b>PrsnPersuasion:</b>

They probably won't and he will develop chronic depression.

That would seem to suggest parents aren't all knowing geniuses. Say it a nit so!!

She left me roses by the stairs.

Not to over step my boundaries but ... what cunts. That poor child deserves to be encouraged and listened to. :( 

<b>Forbizzle:</b>

This is the flaw with the premise of the movie Idiocracy. 

<b>championplaya64:</b>

My parents always did that when I was a kid whenever there was a problem that needing thinking through they never let me help or dismissed every idea I had simply because I was understandably a kid but you still have to at least let your kids try and help or take their suggestions seriously 

<b>howivewaited:</b>

Thats infuriating because the whole point is to be adventurous and curious

OH WAIT I THOUGHT OF ANOTHER ONE 

So we do proposals. Ring in the final puzzle box, proposal signs, whole package deal, people love it. Dude calls up to set up a proposal, I ask what room he wants etcetera. So then I tell him the total price to book out the entire room for the proposal. He says he just wants to buy the two tickets for him and his girlfriend, I tell him we can't have strangers playing a game that their experience is impacted/altered by the fact that there's a proposal going on. Proposal happens in an Escape Room, there's no longer a game, it becomes about the proposal. I know this because I've seen it happen a hundred times. 

Anyway, dude refuses to buy out all of the tickets. Says he wants strangers to be there, he's not going to buy the other four tickets. I hand the phone to my manager, they hash out details together. 

Over the next three weeks leading up to the proposal, this guy calls every. Single. Fucking. Day. There's nothing else to figure out, we've got it all set up, but this guy is constantly badgering us. 

The big day rolls around, he arrives early so he can hide out, and this dude is a kid. Like, pimple-faced, voice-cracking, hair-growing-in-weird-places kind of kid. Everybody in the control room is talking about him, because he's been a thorn in our collective sides for weeks, and we're speculating about telling him marriage at his age is a horrible idea, but whatever it's too late. 

So he hides, the girl and her friends show up, they get started and we stash the dude in the second hidden room that they'll eventually end up in. Everybody crowds around the monitor to watch and this guy pulls out a bouquet of flowers and unfurls a sign that says "NAME REDACTED, will you go with me to PROM?" 

And the entire staff loses their collective shit. Weeks of constant pestering, endless phone calls, and the most stressful proposal deal we've ever put together. For a fucking PROMposal. 

She said no. 

<b>LunaTardis:</b>

cheers for the girl saying no 

<b>Thedarknight1611:</b>
