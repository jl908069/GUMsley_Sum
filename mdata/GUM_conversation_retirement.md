Speaker A:  	Sam has been,
        	has taken such an interest in this retirement bit.
        	That it --
        	it really surprises me.

Speaker B: 	Well she's begun to listen.

Speaker A:  	Yes she has.

Speaker B: 	You know.
        	
Speaker A:  	She has.

Speaker B: 	Uh, she used to go over and read a book or something .

Speaker A:  	Yeah, or turn a deaf ear . That was for sure .

Speaker B: 	But uh,
        	once you understand it,
        	you know, you,
		you're interested in getting right in,
        	and going after it.

Speaker A:  	Yeah.
        	I really oughta call,
        	at least Reg Barr,
        	and ask if uh,
        	he's still speaking to me,
        	 
Speaker B: 	Well now , he was the one that was up on the left, up there .

Speaker A:  	Yeah. Yeah. 
        	Yes.

Speaker B: 	Well he came over to you all smiles,
        	I noticed.

Speaker A:  	Yes.
        	Well,
        	we've known each other for thirty some years,
        	why wouldn't he.
        	But a- anyway,
        	um,
        	I was so glad that he opened up on this disclosure bit.
        	Because it was Burns that's been objecting to our having it.

Speaker B: 	Oh?

Speaker A:  	And I knew this.
        	So when he opened up on that,
        	and she followed through,
        	and told about her husband,
        	you know?
		Not necessarily that she would approve of it,
        	but at least she wasn't disapproving.

Speaker B: 	Yeah.

Speaker A:  	Of it.

Speaker B: 	Yeah.

Speaker A:  	And uh,
        	course Duvall might- --
        	And I- --
        	I cannot get over this.
        	That man.
        	I really cannot.
        	And you know,
        	he must have been thinking,
        	when he said he wasn't a political appointee,
        	he must have been associating his relationship with Steitler.
   	                                                        
Speaker B: 	Oh.
   	
Speaker A:  	I really do believe that.

Speaker B: 	Mhm.

Speaker A:  	In his thinking.
        	I don't know how else he could have  done it.
        	That topples over. Um, but he didn't say that.

Speaker B: 	Oh?

Speaker A:  	He said I loved your  hum-  humor,
        	uh,
        	and I love you,
        	but,
        	I am not a political appointee.
        	And his eyes were just snapping.                
        	And I said oh?
        	How did you get on the board?
        	Well he said,
        	I got a letter from the governor asking.                             
          	Everybody on there is an app- political appointee,
          	that wasn't the point.
          	The point was,
        	I could have mentioned what was in the paper about him,
        	that he was related,
        	you know,
        	had business with Steitler,
        	And I just said,
        	and there's Doctor Duvall,
        	you know?      	      
          	And then I went to Rotus,
        	who's a seasoned politician, if there ever was one.

Speaker B: 	Yeah.

Speaker A: 		He just would flare.
        	And I said,
        	well I- --
        	Alright.
        	I said,
        	I'll apologize next time.
        	And I'm gonna make hay out of it.
        	Don't you worry.
		I wanna know how you birds got on that board,
        	if you're not political appointees.
	  
Speaker B: 	Mm.

Speaker A:  	Oh my.

Speaker B: 	Can I grow some basil?
        	From seed?

SAM:    	Yes,
        	that's how I've- --
        	I don't have any this year,
        	but I've grown it other years.

Speaker B: 	Well --

SAM:    	There's no probl--.
        	It will not take any frost.
        	Soon as the b- 
        	
Speaker B: 	Yeah I- 

SAM:    	A little bit of frost,
        	it's gone.

Speaker B: 	I - --
        	I learned that.
        	one time the- 

SAM:    	I learned it just went down.

Speaker B: 	The hard way.
        	Hm?
        	Uh huh.

SAM:    	Yes?

Speaker B: 	Well I think it was Barbara that has some seeds.

SAM:    	Just- 
        	No problem.
        	It comes right up.

Speaker B: 	Yeah.
        	Yeah.	

SAM:    	I- 

Speaker A:  	Isn't that what you gave the neighbor one time? You gave him some kind of herb.

SAM:    	Did I give him some --
        	I gave him a red pepper.

Speaker A:  	I think you- --
        	I think you gave him some herb of some kind.

SAM:    	I may have given- given him some basil,
        	yes.

Speaker A:  	Yeah.

SAM:    	I don't have any this year,
        	I forgot to plant it,
        	I have oregano.

Speaker B: 	Yeah.

SAM:    	A good stand of it,
        	if you want any.

Speaker B: 	Yeah.
        	I have a lot of dried or- oregano.

Speaker A:  	Is your cigarette out,
        	everybody's.

Speaker B: 	Yeah,
        	it's out.

Speaker A:  	You smoked it down into the cork,
        	didn't you?

Speaker B: 	Pardon?

Speaker A:  	You smoked it down into the cork.

Speaker B: 	Well,
        	yeah,
        	you don't like that, 
		do you, but --

Speaker A:  	No,
        	It chokes me to death.

Speaker B: 	It's- 
		It's there,
        	might as well smoke it.

Speaker A:  	Oh.
          	No good.
			
Speaker B: 	No good.
