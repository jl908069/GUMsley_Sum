# Humans are the only species on earth to try and stop themselves from reproducing 

**Kitten-McSnugglet:**

Pandas do a fine job of avoiding reproduction, too. The lazy bastards. 

**Toby_Forrester:**

I read a good source (another reddit comment) which stated that pandas being notoriously poor at reproducing is a myth. It's just that getting any species in captivity to reproduce is a challenge, so that's why getting pandas in captivity to reproduce is a challenge too. And in the wild they would reproduce just fine, the largest threat to their reproduction is the narrowing of their ecosystems by humans, not their poor talent in reproducing. 

**ughthisagainwhat:**

It's true. Zoos in China with larger panda populations also have far fewer problems getting them to breed. A little bit of male competition really helps. 

**Silly_Swede:**

Yup ... here it is 

**spellred:**

In times of poor food availability, white tail deer stop/slow reproduction. I assume that it also happens elsewhere. 

**KeepGettingBannedSMH:**

There was an experiment that was done with a rat population which was raised in an environment of artificial high abundance of food, water, etc. The population grew rapidly until space became scarce, then many of the rats exhibited complete disinterest in sex/reproduction which persisted even as population size decreased, causing a collapse of the rat society. 

(IIRC)

Ha what a blow hole 

**Kitten-McSnugglet:**

Nah they’re pod people. 

**Costyyy:**

I love all these comments telling OP he's wrong. 

**tinygraycells:**

I think I read that if food was low, rabbits will abort their young and reabsorb them. 

**Nurgus:**

We're the only animal that does it consciously. That we know of. But to be fair, we're the only animal that does anything consciously which involves deep planning. That we know of. 

**Kill\_Da\_Humanz:**

Plot twist: cats are the smartest species on earth and will overthrow humans when we realize that we’re their servants.

**jmmoth79:**

... and for good reason. 

**ProtoMoleculeFart:**

What about the Ai currently proliferating through our computer networks? Don't they count??? WHERE IS YOUR HEART?!?! 

**thenixnerd:**

We’re too fucking good at it. 

**PurpleNHo3:**

How would we know? Perhaps other species went extinct because they stopped reproducing. 

**Toby_Forrester:**

But did they do so planningly? 

**TheRealNokes:**

And eating 

**Grebnerref:**

But we still like to practice. 

**LethalMindNinja:**

I think it's coyotes that will howl at certain times and listen for responses to decide if an area is over populated. Not sure if that means they go somewhere else to hump or just stay where they are and don't hump. 

**2DamnBig:**

In our defense human babies are the worst of all the species. 

**PurpleNHo3:**

How would we know that they didn’t? It’s not to prove that they did, just stating that the option is there. It’s not provable or unprovable.

**Al-Horesmi:**

Yeah other animals just eat their babies 

**Kur0d4:**

This has to do with the fact that raising our offspring is labor and resource intensive. Many species can walk minutes after birth. Due to the size of our heads and the limited size of the birth canal, humans are born relatively premature. Those children then have to be taken care of for years before they can even begin to fend for themselves. 

This is even more pronounced in prosperous societies where only one or two children are even needed and we can legitimately afford not to make children work.
