<h1>Education and early loves </h1>

Byron received his early formal education at [Aberdeen Grammar School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen_Grammar_School "Aberdeen Grammar School") in 1798 until his move back to England as a 10-year-old. In August 1799 he entered the school of Dr. [William Glennie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Glennie "William Glennie"), in [Dulwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulwich "Dulwich").[\[26\]](#cite_note-ODNB-26) Placed under the care of a Dr. Bailey, he was encouraged to exercise in moderation but could not restrain himself from "violent" bouts of activity in an attempt to compensate for his deformed foot. His mother interfered with his studies, often withdrawing him from school, which arguably contributed to his lack of self-discipline and his neglect of his classical studies.

In 1801, he was sent to [Harrow School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_School "Harrow School"), where he remained until July 1805.[\[27\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTECousin191067-27)[\[21\]](#cite_note-nytimes_1898-21) An undistinguished student and an unskilled cricketer, he nevertheless represented the school during the very first [Eton v Harrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eton_v_Harrow "Eton v Harrow") cricket match at [Lord's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord%27s "Lord's") in 1805.[\[28\]](#cite_note-28)

His lack of moderation was not restricted to physical exercise. Byron fell in love with Mary Chaworth, whom he met while at school,[\[21\]](#cite_note-nytimes_1898-21) and she was the reason he refused to return to Harrow in September 1803. His mother wrote, "He has no indisposition that I know of but love, desperate love, the worst of all maladies in my opinion. In short, the boy is distractedly in love with Miss Chaworth."[\[21\]](#cite_note-nytimes_1898-21) In Byron's later [memoirs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron%27s_Memoirs "Byron's Memoirs"), "Mary Chaworth is portrayed as the first object of his adult sexual feelings."[\[29\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMacCarthy200233-29)

Byron finally returned in January 1804,[\[21\]](#cite_note-nytimes_1898-21) to a more settled period, which saw the formation of a circle of emotional involvements with other Harrow boys, which he recalled with great vividness: "My school friendships were with _me passions_ (for I was always violent)".[\[30\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMacCarthy200237-30) The most enduring of those was with [John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_FitzGibbon,_2nd_Earl_of_Clare "John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare")—four years Byron's junior—whom he was to meet again unexpectedly many years later, in 1821, in Italy.[\[31\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMacCarthy2002404-31) His nostalgic poems about his Harrow friendships, _Childish Recollections_ (1806), express a prescient "consciousness of sexual differences that may in the end make England untenable to him."[\[32\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMacCarthy200240-32) Letters to Byron in the John Murray archive contain evidence of a previously unremarked if short-lived romantic relationship with a younger boy at Harrow, [John Thomas Claridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Thomas_Claridge "John Thomas Claridge").[\[33\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMacCarthy20025-33)

The following autumn, he entered [Trinity College, Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge "Trinity College, Cambridge"),[\[34\]](#cite_note-34) where he met and formed a close friendship with the younger John Edleston. About his "protégé" he wrote, "He has been my almost constant associate since October, 1805, when I entered Trinity College. His voice first attracted my attention, his countenance fixed it, and his manners attached me to him for ever." After Edleston's death, Byron composed _Thyrza_, a series of elegies, in his memory.[\[35\]](#cite_note-hudsonreview-35) In later years, he described the affair as "a violent, though _pure_ love and passion". This statement, however, needs to be read in the context of hardening public attitudes toward homosexuality in England and the severe sanctions (including public hanging) imposed upon convicted or even suspected offenders.[\[36\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMacCarthy200261-36) The liaison, on the other hand, may well have been "pure" out of respect for Edleston's innocence, in contrast to the (probably) more sexually overt relations experienced at Harrow School.[\[37\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMacCarthy200239-37) The poem "The Cornelian" was written about the cornelian that Byron had received from Edleston.[\[38\]](#cite_note-38)

Byron spent three years at Trinity College, engaging in sexual escapades, boxing, horse riding, and gambling. While at [Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge"), he also formed lifelong friendships with men such as [John Cam Hobhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cam_Hobhouse "John Cam Hobhouse"), who initiated him into the Cambridge Whig Club, which endorsed liberal politics, and [Francis Hodgson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Hodgson "Francis Hodgson"), a Fellow at King's College, with whom he corresponded on literary and other matters until the end of his life.[\[39\]](#cite_note-39)
